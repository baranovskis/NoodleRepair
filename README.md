# NoodleRepair (Global Game Jam RÄ«ga 2020)
Have you ever experienced being a child? Have you ever broken anything as a child? The answer is simple: YES. What if i told you that there is a way to relive that, but also fix your mistakes...with noodles?! Relive your childhood in the present where you've been on the internet far too much and saw a video where a man repaired objects with noodles. The idea of the game is pretty simple- you are a child (not required to be a child in real life) and you are at home with only one problem: you have broken an object! You must fix the object that is broken with noodles, glue and spray paint- these materials you'll find all over the house. After collecting the materials, you can do the repair work with noodles in just 4 easy steps: put noodles, add glue, paint over it, act like nothing has ever happened. If you are still confused about how this could work go on and try this game! What could go wrong?
